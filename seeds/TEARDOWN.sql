-- seeds/TEARDOWN.sql
--
-- Companion to seeds/PLAN.md. Removes the 8 Silicon Valley fixture users
-- (rhendrix, ebachman, bgilfoyl, dchughta, jdunn, mhall, gbelson, nbighett)
-- and every market, bet, vote, dispute, transaction, and notification owned
-- by them or attached to their markets. Scoping is by Andrew ID, so real
-- OAuth signups under @andrew.cmu.edu are never touched.
--
-- This file is documentation, not auto-applied. Paste into the Supabase
-- SQL editor (or psql with service-role credentials) to run.
--
-- To preview without committing, change the final COMMIT to ROLLBACK.
-- Row-count output appears in the editor's result panel.
--
-- Delete order follows the FK graph since most FKs from referenced tables
-- to profiles/markets do NOT have ON DELETE CASCADE.
--
-- Real users who placed bets on fixture markets are refunded *before* the
-- fixture rows are deleted, so banana_balance stays in sync with the
-- transactions ledger. (An earlier version of this file deleted real
-- users' bet_placement rows along with the fixture market, leaving the
-- balance silently short -- see PR #5 commit history for context.)
--
-- Note on Supabase's database advisor: it flags the two CREATE TEMP TABLE
-- statements below as "tables without RLS". That is a false positive --
-- temp tables live in a private per-session pg_temp_* schema, are visible
-- only to the connection that created them, and disappear at COMMIT via
-- ON COMMIT DROP. RLS does not apply.
