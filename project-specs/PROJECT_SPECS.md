# BananaGains Project Specification

## Project Title

BananaGains: CMU's Prediction Market

## Team Members

- Aaron Tang (`at2`)
- Ted Gershon (`tgershon`)
- Jonathan Gu (`jgu2`)

## Project Overview

BananaGains is a campus prediction market for the CMU community Users create and trade on markets about campus events using a virtual banana currency The product is inspired by prediction market platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi, but it is scoped around campus life and culture

Each user starts with an allocation of "banana currency" Users spend bananas to buy YES or NO positions on markets, and their balances grow when they make accurate predictions The platform uses a parimutuel-style pool model where displayed probability is derived from pool distribution, and winning positions receive a proportional share of the final pool after settlement

For resolution flow, markets are creator-resolved first, but outcomes that are disputed can move into a voter process where neutral voters (who don't bet) stake bananas to vote on the correct result Majority voters are rewarded from the pool to encourage honest voting and provide a governance mechanism for contested markets

## Scope Priorities

To address reviewer feedback about project direction, the team is explicitly separating the project into MVP goals, main goals, and stretch goals This is intended to keep the team focused on a coherent baseline product before expanding into more dynamic or technically ambitious features

### MVP Goals

The MVP is the smallest version of BananaGains that still feels like a real campus prediction market instead of a static demo

- Users can browse markets and open a market detail page
- Users can create a market with a title, description, close time, and resolution criteria
- Users can place YES or NO bets using banana currency
- The application updates balances and market pool totals correctly after each bet
- The application shows a basic portfolio view and a public leaderboard
- A market creator can resolve a closed market
- The application can settle a resolved market and update balances accordingly

### Main Goals

These are the goals that make BananaGains distinct from a very simple betting site

- Persistent backend data for users, markets, trades, and balances
- Market lifecycle from open to close to resolved
- A dispute process that allows contested markets to move into a voter-based workflow
- A voter incentive mechanism that rewards majority voters
- Admin moderation and override tools for broken or unclear market outcomes
- A deployed version of the application that course staff can access remotely

### Stretch Goals

These are worthwhile features, but they are not required for the project to feel complete

- WebSocket live market updates instead of simple polling
- OAuth based auth instead of a simpler local or session-based auth flow, implements non-crypto KYC through verifying Andrew IDs to minimize market manipulation
- Portfolio analytics, charts, or community stats

### Extended Goals (Sprint 4+)

These features extend the platform significantly beyond the original MVP and main goals:

- Non-binary (multichoice) markets with up to 10 options and multiple payout schemas
- Admin review workflow for all proposed markets (pending_review → approved/denied)
- Super admin account with user role management capabilities
- Automated community resolution voting with voter rewards (4% of pool)
- Coin claiming rules with a 5,000 balance cap
- User profile dropdown with GitHub-style avatar menu
- In-app and email notifications via Resend API
- Homepage redesign with hottest market display, trending/top markets, and weekly leaderboard
- Badge and reward track system with 5 tracks and 5 tiers each
- Safety hardening: admin backroll for ambiguous timelines, concurrent bet protection, market immutability after submission

## Design Decisions

### Simple Resolution First

The project will begin with a simple, easy to understand resolution flow before attempting more complex governance

- A market creator resolves the market first
- If a participant disputes the resolution, the market enters a dispute state
- Neutral voters can vote on the disputed outcome with a small banana stake
- Majority voters are rewarded using a fixed, transparent rule
- Admin override remains available if the dispute flow does not produce a clean result

This keeps the resolution process understandable for users and realistic for the course timeline

### Real Time Updates: NOT MVP

Live updates are useful for a prediction market, but they are not required for the project to demonstrate its core value

- The team will prioritize a correct trading and settlement flow first
- Polling is an acceptable fallback if WebSockets are not ready in time
- WebSockets and Redis remain part of the intended technical direction, but they are treated as a stretch or polish feature rather than a dependency for the whole project

### Authentication and Deployment Plan

The team will use a staged approach rather than overcomplicating early sprints

- Sprint 1 may use a demo-user mode so the product flow can be built and demonstrated quickly
- Later sprints will add a more realistic session or authentication flow
- OAuth is a possible stretch goal, not a requirement for the MVP
- Deployment to a cloud-accessible environment is required before the final demo and is planned explicitly in Sprint 4
