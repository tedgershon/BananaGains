## Relationship Summary

- A `UserProfile` can create many `Market` records
- A `UserProfile` can place many `Bet` records
- A `Market` can have many `Bet` records
- A `Market` (multichoice) can have many `MarketOption` records (2–10)
- A `Bet` on a multichoice market references one `MarketOption`
- A disputed `Market` can have many `ResolutionVote` records
- A closed `Market` can have many `CommunityVote` records
- A `Market` can have at most one `Dispute`
- A `UserProfile` can have many `Transaction` records
- A `UserProfile` can have many `Notification` records
- A `UserProfile` can have many `UserBadge` records (one per track)
- A `UserBadge` references one `BadgeDefinition`

## Modeling Notes

- `Market.status` captures the full lifecycle: `pending_review` → `open` → `closed` → resolution → `resolved` (or `denied`)
- `Bet.side` captures `YES` or `NO` for binary markets; `Bet.option_id` captures the chosen option for multichoice markets
- `Transaction.transaction_type` distinguishes wallet events: initial grant, bet placement, payout, voter stake, voter reward, daily claim, and resolution vote reward
- Portfolio state is derived from `Bet` and `Transaction` records
- The `role` column on `profiles` replaces the older `is_admin` boolean for access control, with `is_admin` kept in sync via trigger for backward compatibility
- Community votes (resolution voting) are separate from resolution votes (dispute voting) to support the dual-track resolution model
- Badge progression within a track replaces the previous badge (only the highest tier is stored)
