- market cards and status badges
- market detail page
- filtering or grouping by status or category

Includes:

- YES or NO trade placement
- pool updates and transactional balance deduction
- displayed probability calculation
- closed-market restrictions
- invalid trade amount validation

## 4. User Identity and KYC

- banana balance and initial allocation
- session or login strategy appropriate for the final demo
- wallet state retrieval
- user-specific data access rules

- clear balance changes after settlement

## 6. Leaderboard

The application ranks users by banana holdings and makes competitive progress visible.

Includes:

- creator resolution action
- resolved outcome recording
- settlement calculation
- payout distribution
- frozen settlement window where needed before payout is finalized

## 8. Disputes, Voting, and Governance

If a market resolution is contested, participants can trigger a dispute workflow and neutral voters can vote on the outcome with a small stake. Majority voters receive a reward from the pool.

Includes:

- dispute flagging
- bettor versus voter distinction
- voter staking flow
- majority vote reward logic
- escalation path to admin review when consensus is unclear

## 9. Admin Control

The team needs a moderation surface for invalid markets, abuse handling, and resolution conflicts so the application can be demonstrated safely

Includes:

- admin review tools
- moderation of bad or duplicate markets
- override path for broken or disputed resolutions
- visibility into user, market, and settlement state
- protective rules around misuse and bad data

## 10. Live Updates, Deployment and Demo

The application should feel responsive during demos and must be accessible to course staff remotely by the final review

Includes:

- live or polled probability refresh
- deployment to a remotely accessible environment
- seed data for demo accounts and markets
- presentation and demo script readiness
- final verification that the system is usable from a clean browser session
